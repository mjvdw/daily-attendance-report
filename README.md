1. Create a blank `input.txt` file in the same directory as `main.py`.
2. Copy the text content from today's report into `input.txt`.
3. CD into the script directory using `cd ~/location/of/script`.

### First time set up

4. Create a virtual environment using `python3 -m venv .venv`.
5. Activate the virtual environment using `. .venv/bin/activate`.
6. The first time you run this, you will need to run `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`, which will install the pandas library and other dependencies.

## Running the script

7. Run the script using `python3 main.py`.
