## Set up

1. Create a blank `input.txt` file in the same directory as `main.py`.
2. Copy the text content from today's report into `input.txt`.

## Running the script

3. CD into the script directory using `cd ~/location/of/script`.
4. Activate the virtual environment using `. .venv/bin/activate`.
5. The first time you run this, you will need to run `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`, which will install the pandas library and other dependencies.
6. After they've installed, run the script using `python3 main.py`.

## Output

7. Once the script has run, there should be an `output.csv` file in the script directory.
